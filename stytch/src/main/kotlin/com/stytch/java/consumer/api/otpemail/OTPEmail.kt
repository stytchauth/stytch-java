     * This endpoint also allows you to add a new email to an existing Stytch User. Including a `user_id`, `session_token`, or
     * `session_jwt` in the request will add the email to the pre-existing Stytch User upon successful authentication.
     *
     * Adding a new email to an existing Stytch User requires the User to be present and validate the email via OTP. This
     * requirement is in place to prevent account takeover attacks.
     *
     * ### Next steps
     * Collect the OTP which was delivered to the user. Call [Authenticate OTP](https://stytch.com/docs/api/authenticate-otp)
     * using the OTP `code` along with the `phone_id` found in the response as the `method_id`.
