     * Send a One-Time Passcode (OTP) to a User's WhatsApp. If you'd like to create a user and send them a passcode with one
     * request, use our [log in or create](https://stytch.com/docs/api/whatsapp-login-or-create) endpoint.
     *
     * Note that sending another OTP code before the first has expired will invalidate the first code.
     *
     * ### Cost to send SMS OTP
     * Before configuring SMS or WhatsApp OTPs, please review how Stytch
     * [bills the costs of international OTPs](https://stytch.com/pricing) and understand how to protect your app against
     * [toll fraud](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/toll-fraud/overview).
     *
     * ### Add a phone number to an existing user
     *
     * This endpoint also allows you to add a new phone number to an existing Stytch User. Including a `user_id`,
     * `session_token`, or `session_jwt` in the request will add the phone number to the pre-existing Stytch User upon
     * successful authentication.
     *
     * Adding a new phone number to an existing Stytch User requires the user to be present and validate the phone number via
     * OTP. This requirement is in place to prevent account takeover attacks.
     *
     * ### Next steps
     *
     * Collect the OTP which was delivered to the user. Call [Authenticate OTP](https://stytch.com/docs/api/authenticate-otp)
     * using the OTP `code` along with the `phone_id` found in the response as the `method_id`.
