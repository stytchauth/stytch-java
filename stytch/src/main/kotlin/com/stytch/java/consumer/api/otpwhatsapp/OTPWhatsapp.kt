     * Send a One-Time Passcode (OTP) to a User's WhatsApp. If you'd like to create a user and send them a passcode with one
     * request, use our [log in or create](https://stytch.com/docs/api/whatsapp-login-or-create) endpoint.
     *
     * Note that sending another OTP code before the first has expired will invalidate the first code.
     *
     * ### Cost to send SMS OTP
     * Before configuring SMS or WhatsApp OTPs, please review how Stytch
     * [bills the costs of international OTPs](https://stytch.com/pricing) and understand how to protect your app against
     * [toll fraud](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/toll-fraud/overview).
     *
     * ### Add a phone number to an existing user
     *
     * This endpoint also allows you to add a new phone number to an existing Stytch User. Including a `user_id`,
     * `session_token`, or `session_jwt` in your Send one-time passcode by WhatsApp request will add the new, unverified phone
     * number to the existing Stytch User. If the user successfully authenticates within 5 minutes, the new phone number will
     * be marked as verified and remain permanently on the existing Stytch User. Otherwise, it will be removed from the User
     * object, and any subsequent login requests using that phone number will create a new User.
     *
     * ### Next steps
     *
     * Collect the OTP which was delivered to the user. Call [Authenticate OTP](https://stytch.com/docs/api/authenticate-otp)
     * using the OTP `code` along with the `phone_id` found in the response as the `method_id`.
