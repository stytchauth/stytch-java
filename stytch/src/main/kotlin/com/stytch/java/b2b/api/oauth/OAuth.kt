     * Authenticate a Member given a `token`. This endpoint verifies that the member completed the OAuth flow by verifying
     * that the token is valid and hasn't expired.  Provide the `session_duration_minutes` parameter to set the lifetime of
     * the session. If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch session will be created with a 60
     * minute duration.
     *
     * If the Member is required to complete MFA to log in to the Organization, the returned value of `member_authenticated`
     * will be `false`, and an `intermediate_session_token` will be returned.
     * The `intermediate_session_token` can be passed into the
     * [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms) to complete the MFA step and
     * acquire a full member session.
     * The `intermediate_session_token` can also be used with the
     * [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) or the
     * [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to join
     * a different Organization or create a new one.
     * The `session_duration_minutes` and `session_custom_claims` parameters will be ignored.
     *
     * If a valid `session_token` or `session_jwt` is passed in, the Member will not be required to complete an MFA step.
     *
     * If the Member is logging in via an OAuth provider that does not fully verify the email, the returned value of
     * `member_authenticated` will be `false`, and an `intermediate_session_token` will be returned.
     * The `primary_required` field details the authentication flow the Member must perform in order to
     * [complete a step-up authentication](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/guides/oauth/auth-flows) into the organization. The
     * `intermediate_session_token` must be passed into that authentication flow.

     * We’re actively accepting requests for new OAuth providers! Please [email us](mailto:support@stytch.com) or
