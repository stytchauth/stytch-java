     * This endpoint allows you to exchange the `intermediate_session_token` returned when the user successfully completes a
     * authentication flow to create a new
     * [Organization](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/organization-object) and
     * [Member](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/member-object) and log the user in. If the user wants to log into an existing
     * Organization, use the
     * [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) instead.
     *
     * Stytch **requires that users verify their email address** prior to creating a new Organization in order to prevent
     * Account Takeover (ATO) attacks and phishing.
     *
     * If the user authenticated using a method that **does not** provide real-time email verification (returning password
     * auth, Github/Slack/Hubspot OAuth) this API will return `member_authenticated: false` and an
     * `intermediate_session_token` to indicate that the user must perform additional authentication via one of the options
     * listed in `primary_required.allowed_auth_methods` to finish logging in.
     *
     * If you specified an `mfa_policy: REQUIRED_FOR_ALL` in the request, this API will return `member_authenticated: false`,
     * an `intermediate_session_token`, and `mfa_required` in order to indicate that you must prompt the user to enroll in MFA.
     *
     * Include the `intermediate_session_token` when calling the `authenticate()` method that the user needed to perform to
     * verify their email or enroll in MFA. Once the user has completed the authentication requirements they were missing,
     * they will be granted a full `session_token` and `session_jwt` and be successfully logged in.
     *
     * If the user logged in with a method that **does** provide real-time email verification (Email Magic Links, Email OTP,
     * Google/Microsoft OAuth, initial email verification when creating a new password) this API will return
     * `member_authenticated: true` and a `session_jwt` and `session_token` to indicate that the user has successfully logged
     * in.
     *
     * The Member created by this endpoint will automatically be granted the `stytch_admin` Role. See the
     * [RBAC guide](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/guides/rbac/stytch-default) for more details on this Role.
