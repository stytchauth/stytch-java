     * Send a One-Time Passcode (OTP) to a's phone number.
     *
     * If the Member already has a phone number, the `mfa_phone_number` field is not needed; the endpoint will send an OTP to
     * the number associated with the Member.
     * If the Member does not have a phone number, the endpoint will send an OTP to the `mfa_phone_number` provided and link
     * the `mfa_phone_number` with the Member.
     *
     * An error will be thrown if the Member already has a phone number and the provided `mfa_phone_number` does not match the
     * existing one.
     *
     * OTP codes expire after two minutes. Note that sending another OTP code before the first has expired will invalidate the
     * first code.
     *
     * If a Member has a phone number and is enrolled in MFA, then after a successful primary authentication event (e.g.
     * [email magic link](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-magic-link) or
     * [SSO](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/sso-authenticate) login is complete), an SMS OTP will automatically be sent to
     * their phone number. In that case, this endpoint should only be used for subsequent authentication events, such as
     * prompting a Member for an OTP again after a period of inactivity.
     *
     * Passing an intermediate session token, session token, or session JWT is not required, but if passed must match the
     * Member ID passed.
     *
     * ### Cost to send SMS OTP
     * Before configuring SMS or WhatsApp OTPs, please review how Stytch
     * [bills the costs of international OTPs](https://stytch.com/pricing) and understand how to protect your app against
     * [toll fraud](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/toll-fraud/overview).
     *
     * Even when international SMS is enabled, we do not support sending SMS to countries on our
     * [Unsupported countries list](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/unsupported-countries).
     *
     * __Note:__ SMS to phone numbers outside of the US and Canada is disabled by default for customers who did not use SMS
     * prior to October 2023. If you're interested in sending international SMS, please reach out to
     * [support@stytch.com](mailto:support@stytch.com?subject=Enable%20international%20SMS).
