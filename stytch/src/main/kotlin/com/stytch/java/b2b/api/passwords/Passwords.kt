     * This API allows you to check whether the user’s provided password is valid, and to provide feedback to the user on how
     * to increase the strength of their password.
     *
     * This endpoint adapts to your Project's password strength configuration. If you're using
     * [zxcvbn](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passwords/strength-policy), the default, your passwords are considered valid if
     * the strength score is >= 3. If you're using [LUDS](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passwords/strength-policy), your
     * passwords are considered valid if they meet the requirements that you've set with Stytch. You may update your password
     * strength configuration in the [stytch dashboard](https://stytch.com/dashboard/password-strength-config).
     *
     * ## Password feedback
     * The zxcvbn_feedback and luds_feedback objects contains relevant fields for you to relay feedback to users that failed
     * to create a strong enough password.
     *
     * If you're using [zxcvbn](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passwords/strength-policy), the feedback object will contain
     * warning and suggestions for any password that does not meet the
     * [zxcvbn](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passwords/strength-policy) strength requirements. You can return these strings
     * directly to the user to help them craft a strong password.
     *
     * If you're using [LUDS](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passwords/strength-policy), the feedback object will contain a
     * collection of fields that the user failed or passed. You'll want to prompt the user to create a password that meets all
     * requirements that they failed.
